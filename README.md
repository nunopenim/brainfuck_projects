# brainfuck_projects

This repo contains all my more serious projects in learning Brainfuck, a minimalist programming language, 
more on that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

It will contain simple projects, just for some self reference in future.

You are free to use them for any purpose... If you can.
